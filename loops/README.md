## Loops
### Looping:
Loops are used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat fixed number of times.

### Types of loop
* while loop 
* for loop

### while loop
while Loops is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.
#### SYNTAX :
```python
  while condition:
      statements
```

### for loop
for loop is useful to execute a group of statements several times repeatedly depending upon the number of elements in a sequence.
#### SYNTAX:
```python
 for var in range:
     statements
```

### break statement
The break statement can be used inside a for loop or while loop to come out of the loop.

When 'break' is executed,it jumps out of the loop to process the next statement.

### continue statement
It is used in a loop to go back to the beginning of the loop.

If continue is executed,the next repetition will start.

#### pass statement
pass statement does not do any thing. It is used with 'if' statement or inside a loop to represent no operation.
